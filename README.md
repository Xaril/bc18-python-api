# bc18-python-api

This repository contains the specs and the python API documentation for Battlecode 2018. It has been added in case anybody wishes to play around with this version of Battlecode, as it is not easy to find the links to the documentation otherwise.

All documents in this repository (aside from this README) were created by the creators of Battlecode. If they wish for this to be removed, I will happily oblige.
